#This project is a Data Analysis project. 
I analyzed the Diwali sales data of various customers and used python to draw useful insights from the data.
Used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn python libraries for Data analysis and visualization of different charts.
Provided support to the sales team about the areas of highest sales and lowest sales to improve their overall performance.

Here are the key project learnings-
1. Performed Data cleaning and manipulation.
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) using pamdas, matplotlib and seaborn python libraries.
3. Improved customer experience by identifying customers across different states, occupation, gender and age group.
4. Improved sales by identifying most selling products categories and products, which can help to plan inventories and hence meet the demand.
